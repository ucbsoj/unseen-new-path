## Instructions

An image with the complete layout has been uploaded to the root repo called `NEW PATH_website.png`.

This project is one of the more trickier ones. As you scroll down, there comes a point where the page begins to slide horizontally, even as you continue scrolling downward. It displays a series of data graphics.

All of the slides in the layout are references to the *actual* content, so if it's easier to use static measurements (px) it would be possible. I assume there would be a large gap in the page, and as the user scrolls down a div slides over.
